# West Wind Message Board Sample 
#### A sample application for the West Wind Web Connection FoxPro framework

This is the repository that contains the latest changes to the** West Wind Message Board Sample Application** that ships with West Wind Web Connection. We've removed the sample inside of the installation for a number of configuration issues, and instead have it published here so that the code is always up to date with what is actually running on the live site. 

You can check out the live, running application at:

Here's what it looks like:

### Configuration
This sample application includes self-configuration code that allows you to quickly set up this sample to run either standalone as a compiled EXE, or as an editable application inside the FoxPro IDE.

For more detail on how to set up and configuration the sample please check out this topic in the documentation:
